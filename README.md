# <a name="project-config">Project configuration</a>

The project have specific organisation.

## <a name="pre-commit">Pre-commit</a>

The pre-commit hook is used to check the project before it is commited.
the hook is checking **[the linting](#linting), [the style guide](#style-guide)** and **[build](#build)**.

### Husky

To pre-commit, we're using the [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) tool.

Pre-commit script is located in the `.husky/pre-commit` file.

Because sometimes on Linux, the script is not executed because it do not have right authorisations. There is a script `scripts/prepare_husky.js` that changes chmod only for linux.
This script is executed at the `npm install` command execution.

## <a name="linting">Linting</a>

The linting is checking the code with eslint.
The project is mostly respecting the [airbnb style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
But without **semincolons** and **arrow function**.
Check configuration file `.eslintrc.js`

## <a name="formatting">Formatting</a>

The formatting is checking the code with prettier.
there are basics rules for the code.

```
  singleQuote: true,
  tabWidth: 2,
  trailingComma: "none",
  bracketSpacing: true,
  jsxSingleQuote: false,
  semi: false,
```

Make sure to install the prettier extension for your editor.
You might configure your editor to auto-format the code at save.

Check configuration file `.prettierrc.json`

# <a name="styling">Styling</a>

On that project we're using Scss with no styling library or framework.

The project has a style organisation.
in the style folder, we have:
main.scss and core folder.

all the content of styles folder is globally imported in the project.

## <a name="style-components">Style components</a>

next to a component, add a scss file with the same name as the component.
Then import it in your component.

## <a name="variables">Variables</a>

The variables are used to define the project's variables.
If you want to use global variables, add them in the `styles/core/variables.scss` file.

## <a name="mixins">Mixins</a>

As variables, if you want to use global mixins, add them in the `styles/core/mixins.scss` file.

## <a name="fonts">Fonts</a>

If you want to use global fonts, add them in the `styles/core/fonts.scss` file.

## <a name="functions">Functions</a>

If you want to use global functions, add them in the `styles/core/functions.scss` file.

## <a name="media-queries">Media queries</a>

To respect the project styling organization, please use mixins media query that already exist in the `styles/core/media_querys.scss` file.
It is based on the mobile first approach.

## <a name="normalizer">Normalizer</a>

The normalizer is used to normalize the project's styles.
You might not need to update it.

It is based on [that repo](github.com/necolas/normalize.css).

## <a name="global-styles">Global styles</a>

There is a global styles in the `styles/core/global.scss` file.
